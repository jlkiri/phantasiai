This site now supports [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention)! This means that Twitter likes or retweets will be automatically reflected here thanks to [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/). Webmentions are amazing because you do not have to maintain your own comment database or install third-party services and that is probably too time-consuming for a blog like this anyway. Looking forward to implementing outgoing webmentions as well.
