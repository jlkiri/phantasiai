Are you afraid to start learning to code? I have good news for you - by the end of this post you probably won't be. I will not tell you **THE SECRET**. There isn't one. Instead I am going to reason a little bit.

I want you to do a very simple thing. Something you already can do.

Look at your friends who already make their living coding. If you don't have friends who code, just look at random people who post about programming on the Internet. Seriously, go look at their photos. Look at their Twitters.

Do you notice something? 

These people are just like you. It is very easy to imagine each of them doing something completely different. This person could be a barista and that person could be a dentist. Maybe YOU are a barista who is reading this post. 

In other words, people who can code are not some [galaxy brain](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/galaxy-brain) superhumans who know THE SECRET or have powers that you don't. Don't believe me? Well who do you think wrote this post? Look at my profile pic - I swear I didn't just steal some random dude's photo from Google.

If they could do it, you can do it. 

It is as simple as that. But it is a very powerful thought that I want you to entertain. How do I know that? Well, I was afraid to start too, a few years ago.
